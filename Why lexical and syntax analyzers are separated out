The **lexical analyzer** and **syntax analyzer** are separated in a compiler design for several important reasons related to **modularity, efficiency, and simplicity**. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

## 🔍 2. Why Lexical and Syntax Analyzers Are Separated Out

---

### 1. **Simplification of Compiler Design**

* **Lexical analyzer (lexer)** deals with recognizing **tokens** (keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators).
* **Syntax analyzer (parser)** deals with **structure**, i.e., how tokens form valid statements.
* Separating them allows each to focus on its specific job, making implementation and debugging easier.

---

### 2. **Improved Efficiency**

* The lexer can be implemented using **finite automata**, which is fast and efficient for token recognition.
* By removing whitespace, comments, and irrelevant characters early, the parser deals only with meaningful tokens.

---

### 3. **Reusability**

* The lexer can be reused across multiple parsers or tools like interpreters, formatters, etc.
* Example: A lexer for C can be reused in a C interpreter or static analyzer.

---

### 4. **Modularity and Maintainability**

* Lexer and parser are often developed, tested, and optimized independently.
* Changes in token structure (e.g., new keywords) can be handled in the lexer without touching the parser.

---

### 5. **Error Detection and Recovery**

* Lexers can catch **lexical errors** early (like invalid symbols).
* Parsers can focus on **syntax errors** (like mismatched parentheses or misplaced tokens).

---

### 6. **Support for Parser Generators**

* Tools like **Lex/Yacc** or **Flex/Bison** are based on this separation:

  * Lex generates lexical analyzers.
  * Yacc/Bison generates parsers.
* This separation simplifies automation of parser construction.

---

### 7. **Language Independence**

* A lexer can be used for multiple languages with different grammar but similar token patterns (e.g., identifier rules).

---

### 🧠 In Simple Words:

> **Lexical analyzer** answers *“What are the words?”*
> **Syntax analyzer** answers *“Are the words in the correct order?”*
