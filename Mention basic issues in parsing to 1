Parsing, in the context of computer science and compilers, refers to analyzing a string of symbols (usually source code) according to the rules of a formal grammar. Some **basic issues in parsing** include:

---

### 1. **Ambiguity**

* A grammar is ambiguous if a single string can have more than one parse tree.
* **Issue**: Makes it hard to determine the correct meaning of a statement.
* **Example**: Classic "dangling else" problem in `if-else` statements.

---

### 2. **Left Recursion**

* When a non-terminal calls itself on the left side of a production rule.
* **Issue**: Causes infinite recursion in top-down parsers.
* **Solution**: Remove left recursion or use bottom-up parsers like LR.

---

### 3. **Backtracking**

* Some parsers try multiple alternatives until one succeeds.
* **Issue**: Can be inefficient and may lead to exponential time complexity.
* **Solution**: Use predictive parsers with lookahead or use memoization.

---

### 4. **Error Handling**

* Detecting and recovering from syntactic errors gracefully.
* **Issue**: Poor error handling can make debugging very hard for programmers.
* **Goal**: Provide meaningful error messages and recover to continue parsing.

---

### 5. **Tokenization Dependency**

* Parsing depends on correct lexical analysis (token generation).
* **Issue**: Incorrect tokens from the lexer can break the parser.

---

### 6. **Grammar Conflicts**

* Especially in bottom-up parsers like LR: **Shift/Reduce** and **Reduce/Reduce** conflicts.
* **Issue**: Makes the parser construction difficult or impossible without grammar refactoring.

---

### 7. **Complexity of Grammar**

* Grammars with lots of rules or non-standard constructs are harder to parse.
* **Issue**: Makes parser generation and maintenance challenging.

---

### 8. **Context Sensitivity**

* Parsing context-free languages is easy; context-sensitive features (like variable scope or type matching) cannot be handled by pure parsing.
* **Issue**: Parser alone canâ€™t fully understand certain constructs; semantic analysis is needed.
