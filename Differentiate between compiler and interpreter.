## ‚öñÔ∏è Difference Between Compiler and Interpreter

Both **compiler** and **interpreter** are language translators that convert high-level programming code into a form that machines can understand. However, they differ in how and when they perform the translation.

### üìò **Compiler vs Interpreter ‚Äì Key Differences:**

| Feature                | **Compiler**                                   | **Interpreter**                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Translation Method** | Translates the **entire program at once**      | Translates **line-by-line or statement-by-statement**    |
| **Speed of Execution** | **Faster** (after compilation)                 | **Slower**, as it translates and executes simultaneously |
| **Error Handling**     | Shows **all errors after compilation**         | Stops at **first error** and reports immediately         |
| **Output**             | Generates a **separate executable file**       | **No separate file**; executes directly                  |
| **Example Languages**  | C, C++, Java (compiled to bytecode)            | Python, JavaScript, PHP                                  |
| **Memory Usage**       | Generally **more**, as entire code is compiled | Uses **less**, as it processes one line at a time        |
| **Usage**              | Suitable for **large programs**                | Ideal for **scripting and rapid development**            |

### üß† **In Simple Words:**

* A **compiler** translates the whole book (code) at once and then lets you read it (execute).
* An **interpreter** reads and explains each line as you go.

### üîÑ **Real-World Analogy:**

* **Compiler**: Like translating an entire novel into another language before reading it.
* **Interpreter**: Like having a translator read and translate each sentence aloud to you.
